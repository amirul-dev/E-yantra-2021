# Diary Bike
We design a Dairy Bot comprising a Two Wheeled Self Balancing Robot. The robot loads/unloads dairy products from a dairy farm to designated delivery points. We use a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control strategy for balancing the robot equipped with a flywheel mechanism. After building the bot, we navigate it in an arena to complete a set of tasks.
